## Overview

PromptDefender-Helper is a project designed to handle scoring and improving the security of prompts using GenAI.

We use genkit to provide two key functionalities to a user:

* Prompt scoring - to determine the security of a prompt and its resistance to attacks (particularly prompt injection
  attacks)
* Prompt improvement - to automatically apply improvements to a prompt to make it more secure

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dllewellyn/PromptDefender-Helper.git
    cd PromptDefender-Helper
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```
3. Set up environment variables:
    ```sh
    export PORT=8080
    export TEST_MODE=false
   make run 
    ```
   
## Project Structure

- `main.go`: The entry point of the application. It sets up the HTTP server, initializes dependencies, and starts the
  application.
- `score/`: Contains the logic for scoring prompts.
- `improve/`: Contains the logic for improving prompts.
- `cache/`: Provides caching mechanisms to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- `endpoints/`: Defines the HTTP endpoints for scoring and improving prompts.

## Dependencies

- `gin`: A web framework for building HTTP servers.
- `fx`: A dependency injection framework for Go.
- `genkit`: A toolkit for building AI-powered applications.
- `dotprompt`: A library for defining and generating prompts.

For the frontend, we use:

- `hotwired/turbo`: A framework for building modern web applications.
- `hotwired/stimulus`: A JavaScript framework for building web applications.
- `shepherd`: A library for guiding users through a series of steps.

### Content-Types 

The API accepts and returns JSON data if the content-type is set to `application/json`. Otherwise, it returns HTMl wrapped in 
hotwired turbo.

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
2. Access the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Key Components

### Scoring Prompts

The scoring functionality is implemented in the `score` package. It uses an `LlmScorer` to evaluate prompts and return a
score.

### Improving Prompts

The improvement functionality is implemented in the `improve` package. It uses an `LlmImprover` to suggest improvements
for prompts.

### Caching

The `cache` package provides an in-memory caching mechanism to store and retrieve data efficiently.

### Endpoints

The `endpoints` package defines the HTTP endpoints for scoring and improving prompts. These endpoints are registered in
the `main.go` file.

## Example

To score a prompt, send a POST request to `/score` with the prompt text. To improve a prompt, send a POST request to
`/improve` with the prompt text.

# Testing

## Overview

To run the unit tests, run

```sh 
make test 
```

To run the integration tests, run

```sh
make integration-test
```

### Manual API runs

In vscode, you can use the `REST Client` extension to run the API calls. These are in the folder `/test/http`

### Testing prompts

To test the prompt separately, you can run the app using genkit.

First ensure you have genkit installed, you can follow the instructions here:

[https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit-go/get-started-go](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit-go/get-started-go)

```sh
make genkit_mode
```

### Running Integration Tests for the `/score` Endpoint

To run the integration tests for the `/score` endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the application is running:
    ```sh
    make run
    ```

2. Run the integration tests:
    ```sh
    make integration-test
    ```

The integration tests will load prompt inputs from files in the `tests/prompts/` directory and verify that the defense matches the expected score for each prompt.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    ```
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes:
    ```sh
    git commit -am 'Add new feature'
    ```
5. Push to the branch:
    ```sh
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```
6. Create a new Pull Request.

## GitHub App Integration

### Configuring the GitHub App for Scoring Prompts

To configure the GitHub App for scoring prompts, follow these steps:

1. **Create the GitHub App**:
    - Go to GitHub Developer Settings.
    - Select "New GitHub App".
    - Fill out the basic information, such as the app name, description, and callback URL (use any URL for now; it can be a placeholder if you're just testing locally).
    - Set Permissions:
        - Repository permissions: Set Contents to Read-only.
        - Pull Requests: Set Read & Write (for adding status checks or comments).
    - Set Subscribe to events: Select Pull request.
    - Register the GitHub App.
    - Once registered, you'll get a Client ID and Client Secret. You'll also need to generate a Private Key for authenticating requests from the app.

2. **Build the GitHub App Backend**:
    - Implement a server to receive GitHub webhook events and process them.
    - The server should:
        - Receive Webhook Events: Listen for pull request events.
        - Check for Specific Files: When a pull request is opened or updated, check if specific files are present.
        - Score the Prompt: Use the `score` package to score the prompt.
        - Update PR Status: Post a status check on the pull request based on the result.

3. **Deploy the App**:
    - Run Locally: Start by running the app locally and using a tool like ngrok to forward GitHubâ€™s webhook events to your local server.
    - Set Environment Variables:
        - `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Your GitHub App webhook secret.
        - `GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`: An installation access token for the GitHub App.
    - Deployment Options: For production, deploy to a cloud provider like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean. Ensure the server is accessible by GitHub for receiving webhook events.

4. **Install the App on Repositories**:
    - Once your app is deployed, install it on the repository you want to monitor.
    - When a pull request is created or updated, the app will receive the webhook, check for the specified files, score the prompt, and post a status check result.

### Using the GitHub App

The GitHub App allows you to score prompts and update pull requests with the score. It provides a level of assurance that the updated prompt is still secure whenever you update your prompts.

To use the GitHub App:

1. Install the GitHub App on your repository.
2. Create or update a pull request with the prompt you want to score.
3. The GitHub App will receive the webhook event, score the prompt, and update the pull request with the score and pass/fail status.
